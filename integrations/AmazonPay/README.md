# AmazonPay SFRA Version

To get Amazon Pay cartridge, go to [Amazon seller central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/external-payments/sandbox/home) and click Integration Central. From the solution provider dropdown, select "Salesforce Commerce Cloud" and SFRA version, then get instructions. The current version is 19.1.0
Follow the [documentation](documentation/Amazon%20Payments%20SFRA%20LINK%20Cartridge%20Documentation.docx) to install the cartridges. However, there are some issues during the implementation.

**Setup**
- APN Shared Token. How/Where to obtain the token is not addressed in the documentation or on the website

- Public Key and Private Key. The way to generate keys via Integration Central is incorrect, because the keys generated by Integration Central are not supported by the cartridge code. See the method `getKey()` in ***int_amazonpay_sfra/cartridge/scripts/lib/pssSig.js*** (). To get keys in correct format, you can use an online RSA generator to generate public and private keys, and create a public key in the Integration Central and paste the private key to site preferences.

**Custom Code**
Probably because the code change is for SFRA only, not for Born's AFX. When the frontend JS is added to the build, there will be webpack issues. JS scripts on buttons won't work.
